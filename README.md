# Abalone Age Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a simple implementation of a linear regression algorithm for predicting the age of abalones based on various physical attributes.

## Usage

The provided code uses the scikit-learn library to perform a linear regression on the abalone data. The data consists of physical measurements of abalones such as length, diameter, height, and weight, as well as the abalone's age. The goal of the regression is to predict the age of an abalone based on its physical attributes.

The provided code loads the abalone data from a CSV file using Pandas, splits the data into training and testing sets, and trains a linear regression model using the training data. The model is then evaluated using the testing data and the mean squared error is calculated.

Finally, the code creates a scatter plot of the actual versus predicted age of the abalones in the testing set.

## Heuristics

The provided code uses the mean squared error as the heuristic for evaluating the accuracy of the linear regression model. This heuristic measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values and provides a measure of the model's ability to fit the data.

## Conclusion

This is a simple implementation of a linear regression algorithm for predicting the age of abalones based on physical attributes. The provided code uses the scikit-learn library to perform the regression and the mean squared error as the evaluation heuristic. The code can be modified and extended to include additional attributes or algorithms for improving the accuracy of the predictions.
